        <div class="section-text-container">
          <p>
            Next.js is a renowned open-source JavaScript framework designed for
            building server-side rendered React apps. It offers developers a
            swift and straightforward way to craft efficient and scalable web
            applications, which has made it a favored option for numerous
            companies.

            <p>
              Server and Client Components enable developers to create
              applications that bridge the server and client. This integration
              merges the dynamic interactivity of client-side applications with
              the enhanced performance of standard server-side rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Much like how React revolutionized our approach to crafting UIs,
              React Server Components present a fresh perspective on developing
              hybrid apps that utilize both the server and client. Rather than
              React solely rendering your entire application on the client-side,
              like with Single-Page Applications, it now empowers you to decide
              where your components should render depending on their function.

      <div class="each-section-container">
        <div class="section-name">Automatic static optimization</div>
        <div class="section-text-container">
          <p>
            In this release of Next.js, there's an innovative feature termed
            'automatic static optimization.' This provides developers with the
            capability to enhance their app's performance without delving into
            manual configurations. This functionality autonomously produces a
            static rendition of every page within the app, enabling it to be
            delivered to users without the need for server-side rendering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the box, Next.js inherently optimizes pages without
            asynchronous data needs, such as data pulled from external APIs or
            databases. This implies that for such pages, Next.js pre-builds the
            HTML during compile time, allowing it to be served to users without
            any further server-side computations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The automatic static optimization feature in Next.js is instrumental
            in enhancing an application's performance and scalability. It
            lightens the server's workload and ensures users receive pages
            faster. However, it's crucial to understand that this feature is
            primarily geared towards pages devoid of dynamic data needs. For
            pages that necessitate dynamic data, developers should leverage one
            of Next.js's data retrieval techniques, including
            'getServerSideProps', 'getStaticProps', or 'getServerProps', to
            obtain the required data and execute server-side rendering of the
            page.
